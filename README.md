This project focuses on classifying plastic waste into different categories (e.g., PET, HDPE, LDPE) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It aims to support waste management systems by automating the sorting process for recycling and environmental sustainability.

* I designed and implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture consisting of three layers to extract spatial features effectively and enhance predictive accuracy. The architecture included convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers to reduce dimensionality, and fully connected layers for classification.

* After designing the CNN model, I successfully trained it using the preprocessed dataset, optimizing the parameters to improve accuracy. I monitored the training process using loss and accuracy metrics to ensure the model performed efficiently. Additionally, I structured the notebook with well-organized sections, including detailed markdown explanations, making it easy to follow and understand. These improvements significantly enhanced the projectâ€™s clarity, effectiveness, and performance.
