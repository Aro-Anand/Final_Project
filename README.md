# Week_2
This project focuses on classifying plastic waste into different categories (e.g., PET, HDPE, LDPE) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It aims to support waste management systems by automating the sorting process for recycling and environmental sustainability.
Imported Essential Libraries: Used numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and tensorflow.keras for data preprocessing, visualization, and deep learning model development.
Dataset Acquisition: Downloaded the dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle API for seamless integration and reproducibility.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and processed the dataset to ensure quality and suitability for training.
Data Visualization: Created heatmaps, scatter plots, and other visualizations to identify patterns, correlations, and data distributions.
CNN Model Architecture: Designed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with three layers, including convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers for feature extraction and classification.
Model Training: Successfully trained the CNN model using the preprocessed dataset, optimizing parameters to improve accuracy.
Performance Monitoring: Tracked loss and accuracy metrics during training to evaluate and enhance model efficiency.
